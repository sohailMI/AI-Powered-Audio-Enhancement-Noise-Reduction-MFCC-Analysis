AI-Powered Audio Enhancement: Noise Reduction & MFCC Analysis

🚀 This project applies AI-based noise reduction and speech feature extraction techniques for audio processing. It uses the `noisereduce` library to enhance audio quality and extracts **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs for further analysis. The processed waveforms and MFCC visualizations provide insights into the impact of noise reduction on speech signals.**  

Features:  
- ✅ AI-powered **Noise Reduction** using `noisereduce`  
- ✅ **MFCC Extraction** for speech/audio analysis  
- ✅ **Audio waveform visualization** (Before & After enhancement)  
- ✅ **Speech enhancement techniques**  

Applications: 
🔹 Speech Recognition & Processing  
🔹 Audio Classification & Enhancement  
🔹 Machine Learning & AI-based Speech Systems  
🔹 Noise Reduction for Clearer Voice Signals
